Remeber the concept :
Inventory = Purchase - Sale
Temp Inventory = Ready to Sale -Sale
Temp Purchase Inventory = Purchase - Ready to Sale

1 sku is =>  1 category with 1 size with 1 type bought from 1 supplier

In everyday we will go to `Temp Purchase Inventory ` and add to `Temp Inventory` then we will sale from `Temp Inventory`
